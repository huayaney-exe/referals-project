## Jobs-to-be-Done Framework

### Core Formula: Willingness to Pay = ŒîState √ó Emotional Intensity √ó Problem Frequency

Understanding what coffee shop owners are truly "hiring" our platform to do, measured by the value equation above.

---

### Job #1: üî¥ **"Help me stop losing customers I already worked hard to acquire"**

**ŒîState (Change in Situation):**
- **Before:** 60-70% of new customers churn within 3 months, unpredictable revenue, no visibility into who's leaving
- **After:** 75% retention rate, predictable repeat revenue, AI alerts before customers churn
- **Delta Score:** **9/10** (massive improvement from reactive to proactive)

**Emotional Intensity:**
- **Pain Type:** Loss aversion (watching customers disappear after investing in acquisition)
- **Emotional Drivers:** Frustration ("I worked hard to get them!"), anxiety (revenue unpredictability), helplessness (can't stop the bleeding)
- **Fear Factor:** Existential threat (chains are taking my customers, I'm losing market share)
- **Intensity Score:** **10/10** (deeply emotional - losing customers = losing livelihood)

**Problem Frequency:**
- **Occurrence:** Daily (every day customers don't return)
- **Touch Points:** 40-60 churned customers per month (at 300 active customers, 60% churn rate)
- **Urgency:** Continuous bleeding (not episodic - constant problem)
- **Frequency Score:** **10/10** (always happening, top-of-mind daily)

**Willingness to Pay Calculation:**
- **WTP = 9 √ó 10 √ó 10 = 900 points**
- **Annual Pain Cost:** $1,500-3,000/month √ó 12 = $18,000-36,000/year
- **Estimated WTP:** **$150-300/month** (5-10% of pain cost as acceptable solution cost)

**Current Alternatives (Inadequate):**
- Physical punch cards: 30-40% loss rate, no tracking
- Instagram posts: 2-5% reach, random targeting
- "Hope and pray": Zero control, pure luck

**Success Criteria:**
- See churn rate drop from 60% ‚Üí 30% within 60 days
- Get WhatsApp alerts: "Mar√≠a hasn't visited in 10 days (usually comes weekly) - send offer?"
- Measure retention improvement in dashboard (proof it's working)

---

### Job #2: üí∞ **"Help me acquire customers without burning cash on ads"**

**ŒîState (Change in Situation):**
- **Before:** Spending $10-15 per customer via Instagram ads, limited budget can't scale
- **After:** 35% of new customers from referrals at $1-2 CAC, predictable growth engine
- **Delta Score:** **8/10** (10x improvement in CAC efficiency)

**Emotional Intensity:**
- **Pain Type:** Financial stress (watching ad budget evaporate with poor ROI)
- **Emotional Drivers:** Resentment (Zuckerberg gets rich, I barely break even), envy (chains can outspend me), desperation (need growth but can't afford it)
- **Fear Factor:** Growth ceiling (can't scale without cheaper acquisition)
- **Intensity Score:** **8/10** (high financial anxiety, but less existential than churn)

**Problem Frequency:**
- **Occurrence:** Monthly (every time ad budget is allocated)
- **Touch Points:** 12 monthly budget decisions, daily ad performance anxiety
- **Urgency:** Chronic problem (always need new customers, always expensive)
- **Frequency Score:** **7/10** (constant but less frequent than daily churn anxiety)

**Willingness to Pay Calculation:**
- **WTP = 8 √ó 8 √ó 7 = 448 points**
- **Annual Pain Cost:** $500-1,000/month √ó 12 = $6,000-12,000/year wasted on inefficient acquisition
- **Estimated WTP:** **$75-150/month** (10-15% of wasted ad spend)

**Current Alternatives (Inadequate):**
- Facebook/Instagram ads: Decreasing ROI, expensive
- Flyers: 1-2% conversion, labor-intensive
- "Tell your friends": No tracking, no incentive, random

**Success Criteria:**
- Get 10+ referrals per month via WhatsApp
- Track referral attribution ("Ana referred by Mar√≠a")
- Cut Instagram ad spend by 50% while maintaining growth

---

### Job #3: ü§ñ **"Help me make smart marketing decisions without being a data scientist"**

**ŒîState (Change in Situation):**
- **Before:** Guessing discount rates (20% feels safe?), no idea which campaigns work, treating all customers the same
- **After:** AI tells me "offer 15% not 20% - same results, better margin", segment recommendations, predictive ROI
- **Delta Score:** **7/10** (moves from guessing to data-driven, significant but not transformational)

**Emotional Intensity:**
- **Pain Type:** Competence anxiety (feeling stupid, behind the times, outclassed by chains)
- **Emotional Drivers:** Insecurity (Starbucks has data scientists, I have Excel), FOMO (missing opportunities I can't see), overwhelm (too much data, no insights)
- **Fear Factor:** Competitive disadvantage (chains will win with better tech)
- **Intensity Score:** **7/10** (chronic insecurity, but not as visceral as losing customers)

**Problem Frequency:**
- **Occurrence:** Weekly (campaign creation, discount decisions)
- **Touch Points:** 12 campaigns/year, 52 promotion decisions
- **Urgency:** Episodic (comes up when planning campaigns)
- **Frequency Score:** **5/10** (regular but not daily concern)

**Willingness to Pay Calculation:**
- **WTP = 7 √ó 7 √ó 5 = 245 points**
- **Annual Pain Cost:** $2,500/year in over-discounting + $2,000 in wasted campaign spend = $4,500/year
- **Estimated WTP:** **$50-75/month** (15-20% of waste/opportunity cost)

**Current Alternatives (Inadequate):**
- Excel spreadsheet: Manual, error-prone, no predictions
- "Gut feel": Sometimes right, often wrong, no learning
- Hire consultant: $500-1,000 one-time, not ongoing

**Success Criteria:**
- AI recommendation: "Target 'weekend regulars inactive 14 days', send WhatsApp, expect $340 revenue"
- See margin improvement from optimized discounts
- Dashboard shows "This campaign will generate $500 (85% confidence)"

---

### Job #4: ‚è∞ **"Help me run marketing on autopilot so I can focus on my business"**

**ŒîState (Change in Situation):**
- **Before:** 8 hours/week manually creating Instagram posts, inconsistent, context-switching hell
- **After:** 30 minutes/week reviewing AI-generated campaigns, automated triggers, consistent engagement
- **Delta Score:** **8/10** (70% time reduction, massive operational relief)

**Emotional Intensity:**
- **Pain Type:** Burnout (owner doing everything, wearing all hats, exhausted)
- **Emotional Drivers:** Overwhelm (too many responsibilities), resentment (I opened a coffee shop, not an ad agency), guilt (marketing suffers when I'm busy)
- **Fear Factor:** Sustainability risk (can't keep this pace, will burn out)
- **Intensity Score:** **9/10** (burnout is deeply emotional, threatens quality of life)

**Problem Frequency:**
- **Occurrence:** Daily (constant context-switching between operations and marketing)
- **Touch Points:** 60-80 hour work weeks, 8+ hours/week on manual marketing
- **Urgency:** Chronic exhaustion (always feeling behind)
- **Frequency Score:** **10/10** (relentless daily grind)

**Willingness to Pay Calculation:**
- **WTP = 8 √ó 9 √ó 10 = 720 points**
- **Annual Pain Cost:** 312 hours/year √ó $30/hr opportunity cost = $9,360/year
- **Estimated WTP:** **$100-200/month** (for something that dramatically improves quality of life)

**Current Alternatives (Inadequate):**
- Schedule Instagram posts: Still manual creation, not triggered
- Hire part-time marketer: $300-600/mo, still need oversight, not automated
- Do nothing: Guilt and lost revenue

**Success Criteria:**
- Set up once, runs automatically (birthdays, inactivity, VIP rewards)
- Spend <30 min/week on marketing (review AI suggestions)
- Never miss a campaign opportunity (automated triggers)

---

### Job #5: üì± **"Help me look modern and compete with chains' fancy apps"**

**ŒîState (Change in Situation):**
- **Before:** Physical punch cards feel outdated, customers ask "do you have an app?", losing digital-native customers
- **After:** Digital loyalty in Yape/Apple Wallet, customers brag about my tech, competitive with Starbucks
- **Delta Score:** **6/10** (perception shift from "old school" to "modern", meaningful but not transformational)

**Emotional Intensity:**
- **Pain Type:** Status anxiety (feeling behind, embarrassed by antiquated systems)
- **Emotional Drivers:** Pride (want to be seen as innovative), shame (physical cards feel cheap), defensiveness (customers compare to chains)
- **Fear Factor:** Relevance risk (will Gen Z customers even consider me?)
- **Intensity Score:** **6/10** (ego-driven pain, less urgent than operational issues)

**Problem Frequency:**
- **Occurrence:** Weekly (customers ask about digital options, competitor comparisons)
- **Touch Points:** 10-20 customers/week ask about app or digital loyalty
- **Urgency:** Slow burn (competitive positioning erodes over time)
- **Frequency Score:** **6/10** (regular reminders but not daily crisis)

**Willingness to Pay Calculation:**
- **WTP = 6 √ó 6 √ó 6 = 216 points**
- **Annual Pain Cost:** 10-15% customer preference for chains = ~$5,000-8,000/year lost revenue
- **Estimated WTP:** **$40-75/month** (10-15% of lost revenue opportunity)

**Current Alternatives (Inadequate):**
- Keep physical cards: Works but feels outdated
- QR code to Instagram: Not a loyalty program, confusing
- Build custom app: $10,000-50,000, can't afford

**Success Criteria:**
- Customer sees loyalty card in their Yape/Apple Wallet
- Instant stamp on Yape payment (seamless)
- Customers say "wow, this is as good as Starbucks"

---

### Job #6: üéØ **"Help me reward my best customers differently than bargain hunters"**

**ŒîState (Change in Situation):**
- **Before:** One-size-fits-all offers, VIPs get same 20% discount as one-timers, no differentiation
- **After:** VIPs get 25% and exclusive perks, regulars get 15%, new customers get 10% trial, maximized margin
- **Delta Score:** **6/10** (segmentation capability, meaningful but requires data foundation first)

**Emotional Intensity:**
- **Pain Type:** Fairness frustration (rewarding wrong people, penalizing loyal customers)
- **Emotional Drivers:** Gratitude (want to thank VIPs properly), frustration (giving discounts to people who don't deserve it), strategic clarity (optimize for retention, not just acquisition)
- **Fear Factor:** VIP attrition risk (best customers feel unappreciated)
- **Intensity Score:** **5/10** (principle-based pain, less visceral than operational issues)

**Problem Frequency:**
- **Occurrence:** Monthly (when running promotions)
- **Touch Points:** 12 campaigns/year where segmentation matters
- **Urgency:** Episodic (comes up when planning offers)
- **Frequency Score:** **4/10** (periodic consideration, not daily)

**Willingness to Pay Calculation:**
- **WTP = 6 √ó 5 √ó 4 = 120 points**
- **Annual Pain Cost:** Over-discounting to wrong segments = ~$1,500-2,000/year
- **Estimated WTP:** **$25-50/month** (15-25% of waste)

**Current Alternatives (Inadequate):**
- Memory-based: "I remember Mar√≠a is a regular, give her extra stamp"
- Manual tracking: Excel spreadsheet, too time-consuming
- Ignore: Everyone gets same offer

**Success Criteria:**
- Auto-identify VIP customers (top 20% revenue)
- Different offers per segment (VIP, regular, new, at-risk)
- See margin improvement from targeted discounting

## Critical Shortcomings of ICP

### 1. Customer Retention Challenges üî¥ CRITICAL

**The Problem:**
- **60-70% customer churn rate** within first 3 months
- No systematic way to identify "slipping away" customers
- React to churn instead of preventing it
- Losing $15-30 per churned customer (average LTV)

**Why It Happens:**
- Physical punch cards get lost/forgotten (30-40% abandonment)
- No customer data collection (can't track visit patterns)
- No proactive outreach when customers stop visiting
- Competing coffee shops within 2-3 blocks

**Business Impact:**
- **$1,500-3,000/month revenue loss** from preventable churn
- 5x cost to acquire new customer vs. retain existing
- Unpredictable revenue (can't forecast repeat business)

**Current Solutions (Inadequate):**
- Physical punch cards: Lost, forgotten, not trackable
- Instagram posts: 2-5% reach, not targeted
- Nothing: "Hope customers remember us"

---

### 2. No Data-Driven Decision Making ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH IMPACT

**The Problem:**
- **Zero visibility** into customer behavior patterns
- Don't know who are VIP customers (top 20% revenue generators)
- Can't identify optimal discount rates (guessing 10% vs. 15% vs. 20%)
- No idea which promotions actually drive revenue vs. just give away margin

**Why It Happens:**
- Cash transactions = no customer identification
- Basic POS systems track sales, not customers
- No time/skills to analyze data even if collected
- "Gut feel" marketing instead of data-driven

**Business Impact:**
- **Over-discounting by 5-10%** (could offer 15% instead of 20%)
- Missing high-value customer segments (don't know who to pamper)
- Wasted marketing spend (can't measure campaign ROI)
- Lost upsell opportunities (don't know customer preferences)

**Current Solutions (Inadequate):**
- Excel spreadsheet: Manual, error-prone, time-consuming
- Memory: "I think Maria comes every Tuesday..."
- Ignore problem: "Too busy to think about data"

---

### 3. Ineffective Customer Acquisition üí∞ HIGH COST

**The Problem:**
- **High customer acquisition cost** ($10-15 per customer via Instagram ads)
- **Low referral rate** (5-10% of customers actively refer)
- No systematic referral program (word-of-mouth is random)
- Competing with chains (Starbucks, Juan Valdez) on advertising budget

**Why It Happens:**
- No incentive structure for referrals
- Can't track who referred whom (no attribution)
- Relying on expensive paid ads instead of leveraging existing customers
- Not capitalizing on Peru's 57% social commerce behavior

**Business Impact:**
- **$500-1,000/month** on inefficient customer acquisition
- 10x cost vs. referral-based acquisition ($1-2 per referred customer)
- Limited growth due to high CAC
- Can't compete with chain coffee shop marketing budgets

**Current Solutions (Inadequate):**
- Instagram/Facebook ads: Expensive, decreasing ROI
- Flyers: Low conversion (1-2%)
- "Tell your friends": No tracking, no incentive

---

### 4. Time-Intensive Marketing Operations ‚è∞ OPERATIONAL BURDEN

**The Problem:**
- **5-10 hours/week** manually creating promotions and campaigns
- Inconsistent messaging (post when owner remembers)
- Can't personalize at scale (treating VIPs same as new customers)
- Missing optimal timing (birthday offers sent late or not at all)

**Why It Happens:**
- Manual campaign creation in Instagram/Facebook
- No automation for triggered campaigns (birthdays, inactivity)
- Context-switching between running shop and marketing
- One-size-fits-all messaging (no segmentation)

**Business Impact:**
- **$400-800/month opportunity cost** (owner time worth $20-40/hr)
- Missed revenue from poorly-timed campaigns
- Burnout from constant manual marketing work
- Inconsistent customer engagement

**Current Solutions (Inadequate):**
- Schedule Instagram posts: Still manual, not triggered
- Hire part-time marketer: $300-600/mo, still not automated
- Do nothing: Lost engagement and revenue

---

### 5. Limited Payment Modernization üì± STRATEGIC DISADVANTAGE

**The Problem:**
- **25% of transactions via Yape/PLIN** but no loyalty integration
- Losing digital-native customers who expect seamless experiences
- Can't capitalize on 28% future digital wallet market share (2027)
- Friction in loyalty redemption (manual stamp validation)

**Why It Happens:**
- No loyalty platforms integrate with Yape/PLIN
- Physical punch cards incompatible with digital payments
- Busy owners don't prioritize digital transformation
- Perceived complexity of digital loyalty systems

**Business Impact:**
- **Lost digital-first customers** (25-34 age group preference)
- Competitive disadvantage vs. modern coffee shops
- Missing 24% CAGR digital wallet growth opportunity
- Operational friction (customers ask "do you have digital loyalty?")

**Current Solutions (Inadequate):**
- Physical cards + Yape payment: Disconnected experience
- QR code to Instagram: Not a loyalty program
- Ignore Yape integration: Losing modern customers

---

### 6. Inability to Compete with Chains üè¢ EXISTENTIAL THREAT

**The Problem:**
- **Starbucks Rewards, Juan Valdez loyalty** = sophisticated programs
- Chains offer app-based ordering, personalization, gamification
- Local shops perceived as "less modern" or "less convenient"
- Price competition alone is unsustainable (race to bottom)

**Why It Happens:**
- Enterprise loyalty platforms too expensive ($500-2,000/mo)
- Affordable platforms lack AI/personalization (feel generic)
- No technical team to build custom solution
- Chains have 100x marketing budget

**Business Impact:**
- **10-15% customer preference** for chain loyalty programs
- Lost "convenience" positioning (chains win on tech)
- Pressure to discount aggressively (competing on price, not value)
- Existential risk as chains expand in Peru

**Current Solutions (Inadequate):**
- "We're more personal": True but not scalable
- Compete on price: Margin erosion
- Ignore chains: Losing market share

---

### 7. No Predictive Customer Insights ü§ñ MISSED OPPORTUNITY

**The Problem:**
- **Can't predict which customers will churn** before they do
- Don't know optimal re-engagement timing (text now vs. wait 2 days?)
- Can't forecast campaign performance (will this promo generate $500 or $50?)
- Missing opportunities to upsell based on purchase patterns

**Why It Happens:**
- No AI/ML capabilities in affordable loyalty platforms
- Loopy Loyalty ($25/mo): No AI
- PassKit/Thanx (AI): $500-2,000/mo (unaffordable)
- Gap in market for SMB-priced AI loyalty

**Business Impact:**
- **React to problems instead of preventing them**
- Lost revenue from customers who could've been saved
- Inefficient campaign spend (trial-and-error vs. data-driven)
- Competitive disadvantage vs. chains with data science teams

**Current Solutions (Inadequate):**
- Use affordable platform without AI: Better than nothing, but limited
- Pay for enterprise AI: Unaffordable
- Build custom: No technical resources

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Structural Problems
1. **Fragmented tools:** POS, Instagram, physical cards, Yape = disconnected
2. **No customer data infrastructure:** Transactions ‚â† customer identity
3. **Time poverty:** Owner-operators can't dedicate time to marketing
4. **Pricing gap:** $25/mo (no AI) ‚Üí $500+/mo (enterprise AI)

### Market Failures
1. **No Peru-localized platforms:** Yape/PLIN integration non-existent
2. **WhatsApp not leveraged:** 57% social commerce, zero loyalty platforms use it
3. **AI unavailable at SMB pricing:** PassKit/Thanx only for enterprise
4. **Spanish language neglect:** Most platforms English-first

### Behavioral Factors
1. **Low digital maturity:** Owners don't know what's possible
2. **Risk aversion:** "Physical cards worked for 20 years, why change?"
3. **Immediate urgency bias:** Focus on today's operations, not strategic retention
4. **Lack of data literacy:** Don't understand how to use analytics

## North Star Metrics Framework

### Primary North Star Metric: **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) Increase**

**Definition:** Average revenue per customer over their lifetime as an active patron

**Why This Metric:**
- Captures both retention (longer customer lifespan) and frequency (more visits)
- Directly ties to business profitability and sustainability
- Measurable, quantifiable, and tied to business outcomes
- Aligns incentives (our platform success = customer business success)

**Target:** **+40% LTV increase** within 6 months of platform adoption

**Baseline (Typical Coffee Shop):**
- Average customer: 8 visits before churning
- Average transaction: $5
- Baseline LTV: **$40 per customer**

**With Our Platform:**
- Retention improvement: 8 visits ‚Üí 12 visits (+50%)
- Frequency improvement: Monthly ‚Üí 2x/month

- Multi-reward punch cards (4 stamps, 8 stamps, 12 stamps)

---

#### 6. Time-to-Value (TTV) ‚è±Ô∏è
**Definition:** Days from signup to first measurable retention improvement

**Target:** **14 days** to see retention lift

**Why It Matters:**
- Fast TTV = lower churn risk
- Proves value quickly to skeptical owners
- Reduces onboarding support burden

**How We Move It:**
- 5-minute setup (answer questions, AI does rest)
- Pre-configured campaigns (birthday, inactivity, first visit)

## Strategic Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Yape/PLIN API Access üî¥ HIGH IMPACT
**Risk:** BCP/banks may not provide API access for third-party loyalty
**Mitigation:**
- Plan A: Official partnership with BCP (Yape merchant team)
- Plan B: QR code integration (customer scans at payment)
- Plan C: Manual entry (phone number lookup)

### Risk 2: AI Accuracy Insufficient ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM IMPACT
**Risk:** Churn predictions or discount recommendations not accurate enough
**Mitigation:**
- Start with rule-based system (good enough)
- Layer in ML as data accumulates
- Transparent confidence scores ("70% confident")

### Risk 3: Business Owner Adoption Friction ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM IMPACT
**Risk:** Low digital literacy = setup abandonment
**Mitigation:**
- WhatsApp onboarding support (not email)
- 5-minute setup wizard (AI does heavy lifting)
- In-person setup for pilot customers (white-glove)

### Risk 4: Competitive Response üî¥ HIGH IMPACT
**Risk:** Loopy Loyalty or Stamp Me add Yape integration
**Mitigation:**
- Speed to market (first-mover advantage)
- AI moat (harder to replicate)
- Peru-specific features (WhatsApp, Spanish)
- Partnership with Yape (exclusivity?)
