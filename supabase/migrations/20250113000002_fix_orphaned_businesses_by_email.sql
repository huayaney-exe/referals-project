-- ============================================
-- FIX: Link orphaned businesses by matching email
-- Handles businesses created before owner_id migration
-- ============================================

-- Scenario: User exists in auth.users, business exists in businesses table
-- but owner_id is NULL because user_metadata.business_id was never set
-- Solution: Match by email and link them
