# PRD Scope Simplification Summary

**Date**: January 2025
**Status**: APPROVED - Simplified MVP
**Previous Version**: PRD-AI-Loyalty-Platform-Peru.md (Full AI/Yape scope)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SCOPE CHANGES

### ‚ùå OUT OF SCOPE (V1)

1. **Yape/PLIN Payment Integration**
   - Reason: Complex partnership dependency, API access uncertain
   - Defer to: Phase 2 (after pilot validation)
   - Impact: Manual stamping via iOS app sufficient for MVP

2. **AI/ML Predictive Analysis**
   - Reason: Requires training data, increases complexity and cost
   - Defer to: Phase 2 (after collecting 3-6 months pilot data)
   - Impact: Rule-based automation sufficient for retention (Stamp Me proves 15-30% lift without AI)

### ‚úÖ IN SCOPE (V1 - Simplified MVP)

1. **Apple Wallet Digital Punch Cards**
   - Generate .pkpass files for Apple Wallet
   - Customizable design (logo, colors, reward tiers)
   - QR code enrollment
   - Card updates via API (add stamp, trigger notifications)

2. **Rule-Based Automated Retention Alerts**
   - Configurable inactivity threshold (e.g., 14 days)
   - WhatsApp automated campaigns with variables
   - Dynamic discount code generation (e.g., "MARIA15")
   - Template library (10+ pre-written Spanish messages)

3. **Admin Dashboard with Retention Metrics**
   - Active customer count
   - 3-month retention rate (cohort-based)
   - At-risk customer list (sorted by days inactive)
   - Campaign analytics (open/redemption rates)
   - Retention trend chart

4. **Everything Else Not Explicitly Removed**
   - iOS stamper app (scan QR, manual entry, offline mode)
   - WhatsApp Business API integration (Twilio)
   - Setup wizard (5-minute onboarding)
   - Customer visit tracking
   - Campaign scheduling and personalization
